# Google-Colab
In order to get started on today’s exercise, you will need to open a Google Colab notebook from GitHub. Here is how you can do that:

- Navigate to the Day3Rotation3 notebook in this repo
  - This will take you to the notebook we will be using for this rotation. It will include some orientation material for google colab as well as the main exercises
- Once you are on the GitHub page for the notebook you should see a blue button right above the top of the notebook. It will say “Open in Colab.” Press it.
- You should now have the notebook opened in Google Colab.

Please follow the instructions in the notebook. Once you have worked through the introduction notebook, move on the others in this order:

- **PDGD Attack:** pdgd_attack_adv_training_ipynb
- **FGSM Attack:** Jordan_FGSM_Demo
- Choose from one of the following for the **Trojan Attack** (depending on your data set preference):
  - **GPRW Dataset:** TrojanAttackAndAutoencoderDemoCNN1D_GPWRDataNotebook.ipynb
  - **Ashera Dataset:** TrojanAttackAndAutoencoderDemoNotebookTrojanCNN2D_AsherahData.ipynb

If you find yourself short on time, you may substitute the choise of the last two for the DemoGPWR_AutoencoderToDetectTrojanTrigger.ipynb notebook, which demonstrates the defense but not the attack.
